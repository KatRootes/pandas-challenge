# pandas-challenge : PyCitySchools
This homework demonstates the use of the pandas library within Jupyter notebooks using DataFrames, groupby, descriptive statistics and binning.

# Two Observable Trends
1) Based on the 5 top and bottom performing schools in addition to the passing rates by school type, it is clear within this school district that Charter schools outperform district schools.
2) In general, medium schools with per student spending <$615 have better passing rates.


# Observations
* The top 5 performing schools are charter and the bottom 5 performing schools are district.
* There is less variation between grades in the same school then from school to school.
* Math scores vary more than reading scores overall.
* Higher Per student spending does not result in higher passing results for Math or Reading.
* Medium schools have the best reading and overall passing rates and large schools have the worst math passing rates.
* Charter schools have the best overall passing rates.

# NOTEs:
* There are multiple ways to perform certain functions.  In some cases I took the time to document within the Jupyter notebook more than one way with assumptions and drawbacks.
* Summary charts were formatted to what I prefer for precision, therefore I consistently included full precision in prior steps to validate numbers as needed.
* Opening the Jupyter file in Git Hub is a mess for some tables - open in Jupyter Notebooks to read clearly.
